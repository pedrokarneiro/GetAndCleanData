# GetAndCleanData
This is the Github repository with my script for performing the analysis, containing also a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. Include a README.md. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

# Filename: run_analysis.R
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of
  each variable for each activity and each subject.

All the information regarding how the script works is described within the script run_analysis.R
