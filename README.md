# GetAndCleanData
This is the Github repository with my script for performing the analysis, containing also a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. Include a README.md. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
